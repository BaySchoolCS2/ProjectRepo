Whrpl was created as a space to share your thoughts and ideas free from the chains of your identity. Here you can be yourself without worry of making mistakes. It was designed with the explicit intention of being a safe space to make mistakes. Your identity on the forum is protected from repercussions in the real world. By posting your ideas here you understand that they will be mercilessly be critiqued. Be aware that by posting your idea you are broadcasting it to the entire world. If you understand that other people have different views and in this method of communication people are less opposed to speaking their mind because they are not tied to their own physical self.

While freedom of speech is expressly built in to this communication system this does not give you a free pass to share the real identity of other people or yourself. Nor are you allowed to assassinate the character of other people. Generally logical, evidence based arguments better than non-logical arguments. They tend to contribute to the conversation more. If you do not understand logic please see this list of [logical fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies). As a rule of thumb this will keep you from making a fool of yourself. There are other guidelines that you must follow as well.

1. Don't be a jerk, if someone says something incorrect, correct them. Provide evidence against their argument, point out holes. Allow them to defend it.
2. Don't abuse others.
3. Don't post the names, location, or otherwise identify other users or people.
4. Offending people is always a possibility. However going out of your way to offend a group of people is unacceptable. Usually there is a better way.
5. Freedom of speech applies to everyone, not just yourself.
